/* You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writting "string"[N]. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position 0, whic causes the last one to be found at string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its character have positions 0 and 1. 

Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and return a number that indicates how many uppercase "B" characters there are in the string. 

Next write a function called countChar that behaves like countbs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase "B" characters). Rewrite countsBs to make use of this new function. */
